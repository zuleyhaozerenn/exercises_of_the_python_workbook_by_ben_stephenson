"""
In the United States, fuel efficiency for vehicles is normally expressed in miles-pergallon (MPG).
In Canada, fuel efficiency is normally expressed in liters-per-hundred
kilometers (L/100 km). Use your research skills to determine how to convert from
MPG to L/100 km. Then create a program that reads a value from the user in American
units and displays the equivalent fuel efficiency in Canadian units.
